### Objective

- After each move, a new tile (2 or 4) appears randomly
- Game ends when no more moves are possible
- Reach 2048 to win, but you can keep playing for higher scores!

### Scoring
- Each merge adds the new tile's value to your score
- Example: 2+2=4 adds 4 points
- Larger merges = more points
- Try to beat your high score!

## 🧠 Strategy Tips

- **Corner strategy** - Keep your highest tile in a corner
